# Dosimat-876-Plus-API
Dosing unit with GUI for precise liquid dosing. Control via serial connection to the dosimeter. Start/stop of the dosing process, method maintenance, instrument status query. Two scripts for GUI and communication.


The project consists of a dosing unit connected to a dosimeter and controlled via a graphical user interface (GUI). The dosing unit enables the precise dosing of liquids in different quantities.

The main function of the programme is to control the dosing unit via the GUI. The GUI allows the user to perform various actions, such as starting and stopping the dosing process, stopping a running method and retrieving the instrument status.

The programme uses a serial connection to communicate with the dosimeter. It opens a serial connection to the dosimeter and sends various commands through this connection to control the dosing process and retrieve information.
