# Dosimat-876-Plus-API
Dosing unit with GUI for precise liquid dosing. Control via serial connection to the dosimeter. Start/stop of the dosing process, method maintenance, instrument status query. Two scripts for GUI and communication.


The project consists of a dosing unit connected to a dosimeter and controlled via a graphical user interface (GUI). The dosing unit enables the precise dosing of liquids in different quantities.

The main function of the programme is to control the dosing unit via the GUI. The GUI allows the user to perform various actions, such as starting and stopping the dosing process, stopping a running method and retrieving the instrument status.

The programme uses a serial connection to communicate with the dosimeter. It opens a serial connection to the dosimeter and sends various commands through this connection to control the dosing process and retrieve information.

Functional overview

Universal dispenser for manual titrations and dosing. Incl. push-button cable for manual dispensing control and exchange unit 20 mL. You can connect a variety of devices to the USB interface of the Dosimat plus, with a USB hub even several at the same time (keyboard, mouse, USB compact printer or USB DIN A4 printer, USB memory stick for method and data backup). The optional USB/RS232 adapter box 6.2148.030 enables the connection of laboratory balances and control with a PC. With its two dosing modes, the Dosimat plus offers the following applications:

DOS (Dosing) - Dosing at the touch of a button.

This mode is particularly suitable for carrying out manual titrations with an indicator. A result can be calculated automatically from the dosed volume and a result report printed out.

XDOS (Extended dosing) - Controlled dosing

    Dose fixed volume: The volume and the dosing rate are predefined.
    Time-controlled dosing: The volume and time are preset.
    Dosing according to dosing rate: The dosing rate and the time are preset.
